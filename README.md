# Your Day, Your Way
Your Day, Your Way is a website designed to allow the user complete control over their exercise and diet plan for each day of the week. The site provides the user the ability to plan ahead which increases the likelihood of a user sticking to a diet and exercise plan. Alongside being able to choose meals and workouts already provided on the site, users can add, edit and delete their own recipes and workouts and have read only access to what others have added too. Each week, users can select what they would like to have for breakfast, lunch and dinner each day and decide on which days they will be working out and when to rest. Being able to plan in such a way in one convenient place makes shopping easier and if you don’t have as much time as you thought to workout, no problem, just pick a new workout – it’s your day, your way.
